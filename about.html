								<p>	After achieving a first-class degree in Computer Games Design and Programming, 
									I wanted in enhance and refine my skills. I decided complete a Masterâ€™s degree at 
									Staffordshire University in 3D Games. Due to my passion for games, in addition to 
									completing my university work I have participated in many Games Jams. My involvement in 
									Games Jams as given me unique experience in collaboration skills and I have managed to be 
									apart of a team who have won a jam and a Jamfuser that came 3rd overall.  
								</p>
								<p>
									When I am not creating or playing games, I enjoy a wide variety of hobbies such as building and flying 
									elite racing drones capable of speeds over 150 mph. These drones are flown using first person perspective goggles 
									which give an incredible experience while flying. Having grown up in Devon nestled around Dartmoor, I enjoy 
									hiking and camping. Twice I even partook in the Ten Tours challenge, walking and navigating 35 miles over Dartmoor 
									in a day and a half.
