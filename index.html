								<p>	
									After earning my first-class degree in Computer Games Design and Programming, my desire to enhance and 
									refine my skills led me to pursue a Master's degree at Staffordshire University, specializing in 3D Games. 
									My deep passion for gaming drove me not only to excel in my academic coursework but also to actively engage 
									in numerous Game Jams. 
									My active participation in Game Jams has provided me with invaluable experience in collaborative work. I'm proud to have been a part 
									of a winning team in one of these Game Jams, and I also achieved a commendable 3rd place finish in a Jamfuser competition. These experiences 
									have not only honed my technical skills but have also showcased my ability to work effectively within a team.
								</p>
								<p>
									Beyond my involvement in game creation and playing, I take immense pleasure in a range of hobbies. One of my foremost passions involves building and 
									piloting high-speed racing drones, capable of surpassing 150 mph. The thrill of flying these drones, combined with the immersive experience of 
									first-person perspective goggles, is truly exhilarating.
									Growing up amidst the picturesque landscapes of Devon, surrounded by the beauty of Dartmoor, I've developed a profound love for nature. 
									Hiking and camping have become cherished pastimes, including twice tackling the challenging Ten Tors expedition, covering an impressive 35 miles of 
									Dartmoor terrain in just a day and a half.
