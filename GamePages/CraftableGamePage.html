											The tool was an implementation of the type of tools that I expect Mojang (Minecraft Developer) would have to facilitate
											designers to create items and recipes for the crafting system quickly and effectivly. This ment all items and 
											recipes created with the tool would automatically work with the inventoory and crafting system in place.

										<h2>Item Creation Tool</h2>
										<p>
											The item creation tool is used to create items by putting in the necessary data into the input parameters of the tool.
											Once the designer is happy with the inputed data, they can click create. This will create a data asset within the 
											project content browser under the items folder. The data asset is then used by the item actor to turn the actyor into 
											that item by only using the dat provided. A list of all the items can be seen on the left hand side of the tool. 
											Each item can also be edited within the tool and this will change the data asset too. Once any item has been created,
											edited or if not all required dat is inputed the Tool Output Log will inform the user that the item was created, edited 
											or needs futher dat to be created.

										<h2>Recipe Creation Tool</h2>
										<p>
											The recipe creation tool is used to create recipes for the crafting system. It does this by displaying a crafting table 
											much like the one the player will see when they interact with a crafting table. The displayed crafting table in the tool
											can have items draged onto it from the list of items on the left. Once the designer has given the recipe a name, filled in
											the crafting pattern of the item and populated the result item box, the recipe can be made by clicking the create button. 
											similar to the item creation tool, recipes can be edited by click the recipes tab in the top left and clicking on the recipe.

										<h2>Item Creation</h2>
										<p>
											The image on the left shows the logic flow of how the items are created when the designer has entered all the data 
											into the item creation tool. On the create button clicked we first check that it is a valid item that has been inputed.
											if it is not we log out an error to the designer. If it is valid we then create the item within the content folder, 
											clear all of the inputed data in the tool, refresh the item list so the new created item will show and finally log
											out to the desinger the item was created successfully.

										<h2>Item Creation</h2>
										<p>
											The image on the right shows the way recipes are create using the tool. Simlar to how the items are created, this diagram
											begins when the designer has clicked the create button. The recipe is check if it is valid by making sure the result is not 
											empty and items are in the crafting table it's self and has a valid name. If the recipe is not valid it will display an 
											error to the designer. However, if the recipe is valid the recipe is created using the information populated in the tool
											and a debug log showing the recipe has been created is displayed to the designer.

											The video shows a demonstration on how the tool works, revealing the way both items and recipes are created.
											Once the items and recipes are created the trailer shows how the crafting and inventory system is then used from
											a players point of view. This displays how the sytems are working together so that items and recipes can be created 
											easily for this system.
